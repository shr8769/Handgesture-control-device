## Overview

This project presents a hand gesture-controlled computer system using an Arduino Uno, two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, and one PIR motion sensor. The system enables touch-free interactions by interpreting specific hand movements and motions as control commands.

- **Ultrasonic sensors** measure hand distances to trigger gestures for scrolling and media navigation (forward/backward).
- **PIR sensor** detects motion for play/pause functionality.
- The Arduino processes sensor data and communicates with a Python script via serial communication.
- The Python script (using PyAutoGUI) simulates keystrokes to control system functions.

This cost-effective solution enables intuitive human-computer interaction with applications in accessibility, smart environments, and touchless computing.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Control games (e.g., Subway Surfers) with arrow key gestures
- ðŸŽµ Play/pause, next, and previous media tracks
- ðŸ“œ Scroll through web pages and documents
- ðŸ‘‹ Activate play/pause with motion detection
- ðŸ’» Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Installation

### 1. Hardware Setup

- Assemble the sensors and connect them to the Arduino as shown above.

### 2. Arduino Code

- Upload the provided Arduino code to your Uno using the Arduino IDE.

### 3. Python Environment

- Install Python 3.7 or later.
- Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install pyserial pyautogui
  ```

### 4. Python Script

- Edit `gesture_controller.py` to set the correct COM port for your Arduino.
- Run the script:
  ```
  python gesture_controller.py
  ```

## Usage

- Place your hands in front of the sensors as per the gesture table below.
- The system will detect gestures and trigger the corresponding computer actions.

## Gesture Reference

| Gesture                      | Action           | Distance Range                       |
|------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Both hands close             | Scroll Down      | â‰¤ 20cm both sensors                  |
| Both hands medium            | Scroll Up        | 20â€“50cm both sensors                 |
| Left hand close, right far   | Previous/Back    | Left â‰¤ 10cm, Right â‰¥ 30cm            |
| Right hand close, left far   | Next/Forward     | Right â‰¤ 10cm, Left â‰¥ 30cm            |
| Motion detection             | Play/Pause       | PIR sensor activation                |

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No response?**  
  Check your COM port and wiring.
- **Gestures not detected?**  
  Ensure sensors are powered and unobstructed.
- **Python errors?**  
  Confirm all dependencies are installed and permissions are set.
